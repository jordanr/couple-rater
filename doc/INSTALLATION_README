Couple Rater Installation and Deployment Instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Preliminary Instructions:
-------------------------

Untar and unzip the couple_rater.tar.gz file into a directory where you would like the
Couple Rater software to reside. Change into the 'couple_rater' directory, which will
be called {ROOT} in the rest of this document.

Install all "System Requirements" outlined in DEVELOPERS_README.

Add the "Developer" app to your Facebook account by logging into your account
and going to 'http://www.facebook.com/developers/'.


Creating the App in Facebook:
-----------------------------

After adding the Developer app, go to it by clicking on the Developer app link on
the list of apps on the left hand side of your Facebook home page. Click on "Set Up
New Application" in the top right corner. Enter a name for your application, check the box, 
and click "Submit." Now open '{ROOT}/conf/facebooker.yml'. From the page you are now seeing
in your browser, you should see an "API Key" and "Secret Key". Copy these into either the
'development' or 'production' sections of facebooker.yml. Use the former if you are
developing Couple Rater or the latter if you are trying to deploy a production copy
of Couple Rater. Now click on "Edit Settings" in your browser. Enter a "Callback URL", which
is the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the server hosting Couple Rater. Make sure to
use an available port and note this port number for later use. Finally, enter a
"Canvas Page URL", which is the URL users see and use to access your app, and choose "yes"
for "Can your application be added on Facebook?".


Running the Couple Rater Software:
----------------------------------

From the {ROOT} directory, execute 'rake db:migrate' to create a new database for
your Couple Rater app.

From the {ROOT} directory, run 'ruby script/server -p <port_num>', where port_num is
the available port number that you used in the "Callback URL" above. This will start
the server for Couple Rater and, if no errors are shown and all the above steps have
been successfully followed, you have successfully deployed Couple Rater.

Optional: Run 'rake test' from the {ROOT} directory to run the included test suite. See
DEVELOPERS_README for more information on running tests.

Go to your Canvas Page URL (http://apps.facebook.com/<url_you_entered_here>) to begin
using Couple Rater.
