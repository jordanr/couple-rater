<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
<p>The terms and conditions below describe the terms applicable to your installation and use of certain applications 
which use the Facebook Platform (as defined below)  to access certain information about you that is available from the <a 
href="http://www.facebook.com/">www.facebook.com</a> website (the "<strong>Facebook Site</strong>") or to retrieve 
authorized data from third-party sites for use on the Facebook Site ("Platform Applications"). </p>
<p>The "Facebook Platform" is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) and services provided by Facebook which 
makes this information available to Platform Applications and allows Facebook and third-party developers ("Developers") 
to develop new features and applications that we hope will enhance your ability to interact with people in your life in 
new and interesting ways.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: The Facebook Platform does not give Developers access to  your e-mail address, personal website, 
instant messenger ID, telephone number or street address ("Contact Information"). Facebook will only disclose your 
Contact Information to third parties in accordance with the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Facebook Privacy 
Policy</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>II. Consent Regarding Use of Facebook Site Information</h3>
<p>(a) <strong>Information That May Be Provided to Developers.</strong> In order to allow you to use and participate in 
Platform Applications created by Developers ("Developer Applications"), Facebook may from time to time provide Developers 
access to the following information (collectively, the "Facebook Site Information"): </p>
<p>(i) any information provided by you and visible to you on the Facebook Site, excluding any of your Contact 
Information, and </p>
<p>(ii) the user ID associated with your Facebook Site profile. </p>
<p>(b) <strong>Examples of Facebook Site Information.</strong> The Facebook Site Information may include, without 
limitation, the following information, to the extent visible on the Facebook Site: your name, your profile picture, your 
gender, your birthday, your hometown location (city/state/country), your current location (city/state/country), your 
political view, your activities, your interests, your musical preferences, television shows in which you are interested, 
movies in which you are interested, books in which you are interested, your favorite quotes, the text of your "About Me" 
section, your relationship status, your dating interests, your relationship interests, your summer plans, your Facebook 
user network affiliations, your education history, your work history, your course information, copies of photos in your 
Facebook Site photo albums, metadata associated with your Facebook Site photo albums (e.g., time of upload, album name, 
comments on your photos, etc.), the total number of messages sent and/or received by you, the total number of unread 
messages in your Facebook in-box, the total number of "pokes" you have sent and/or received, the total number of wall 
posts on your Wall&trade;, a list of user IDs mapped to your Facebook friends, your social timeline, and events 
associated with your Facebook profile.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Privacy Settings</strong>: You may revoke or modify your permission for Facebook to provide Facebook Site 
Information to Developers at any time through the means provided in your <a 
href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/">privacy settings</a>. </p>
<p>(d) <strong>Developer Agreement</strong>.  Before providing any information to any Developer through the Facebook 
Platform, Facebook requires each Developer to enter into an agreement (a "<strong>Developer Agreement</strong>"), which, 
among other things, strictly limits their collection, use, and storage of Facebook Site Information.  Our standard 
Developer Agreement consists of the Facebook Developer Terms of Service and the related Facebook Platform Application 
Guidelines. We may from time to time enter into separate agreements with certain third party Developers that contain 
different or additional terms, provided however, that each such separate agreement will require the third party Developer 
to only display your information in accordance with your Facebook privacy settings.  The standard Developer Agreement is 
subject to change without prior notice at any time, in the Company's sole discretion, so you should review these terms 
from time to time.  However, Facebook cannot guarantee that each Developer will comply with its contractual requirements, 
and Facebook does not assume any liability or responsibility for any of Developer's actions, Developer Applications or 
websites, or for enforcing any Developer Agreement against any Developer. </p>
<p>(e) <strong>Facebook Applications.</strong> Platform Applications developed by Facebook ("Facebook Applications") may 
also make use of Facebook Site Information. Facebook will use and disclose Facebook Site Information in connection with 
Facebook Applications only in accordance with the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Facebook Privacy 
Policy</a>.</p>
<h3>III.  Use of Platform Applications</h3>
<p>(a)  <strong>Developer Applications.</strong>  When you install a Developer Application, you understand that such 
Developer Application has not been approved, endorsed, or reviewed in any manner by Facebook, and we are not responsible 
for your use of or inability to use any Developer Applications, including without limitation the content, accuracy, or 
reliability of such Developer Application and the privacy practices or other policies of the Developer.  YOU USE SUCH 
DEVELOPER APPLICATIONS AT YOUR OWN RISK.   Developers may require you to agree to their own terms of service, privacy 
policies and/or other policies as a condition of using Developer Applications. Those terms and/or policies may give 
Developers rights with respect to your Facebook Site Information beyond those provided by the Developer Agreement.  
PLEASE REVIEW EACH DEVELOPER'S TERMS AND/OR POLICIES CAREFULLY.</p>
 <p>(b) <strong>Facebook Applications.</strong>  Facebook Applications are made available to you for your personal, 
non-commercial use only. If you want to sell, license or otherwise distribute any Facebook Application, reproduce or 
modify any Facebook Application, or use any Facebook Application for any commercial purpose, you must obtain Facebook's 
prior written consent.  Facebook may require you to agree to additional or different terms of use and may notify you of 
additional or different policies that may apply to particular Facebook Applications.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Facebook Terms of Use.</strong>  You understand and agree that your use of any Platform Application is 
subject to, and you agree to comply with, all terms and conditions of the <a 
href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Facebook Site Terms of Use</a>, including without limitations  all disclaimers 
and limitations of liability contained therein.  To the extent these Platform Application Terms of Use directly 
contradict such Facebook Site Terms of Use, these Platfrom Application Terms of Use shall control: Without limiting the 
foregoing, all restrictions on user conduct set forth in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Facebook Site 
Terms of Use</a>, also apply to your use of and all information and content you provide on or through any Platform 
Applications, and to your conduct in using any Platform Applications;</p>
<p>(d) You acknowledge that Developers or Facebook or its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to any and 
all Platform Applications, portions thereof, and/or content or software provided through or in conjunction with any 
Platform Applications, including without limitation any and all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other 
proprietary rights, and any and all applications, renewals, extensions and restorations thereof, now or hereafter in 
force and effect worldwide. You also agree to not remove, obscure, or alter Facebook's or any third party's copyright 
notice, trademarks, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within or accessed in conjunction with or 
through any Platform Applications. You agree not to modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, decompile, 
reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code from any Platform Applications; and</p>
<p>(e) ALL PLATFORM APPLICATIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. FACEBOOK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS TO THE 
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. FACEBOOK 
FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, AVAILABILITY AND/OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY 
PLATFORM APPLICATIONS. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU DOWNLOAD, INSTALL AND/OR USE ANY PLATFORM APPLICATIONS AT YOUR 
OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA 
THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD, INSTALLATION OR USE OF ANY PLATFORM APPLICATIONS. SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO 
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER 
RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. </p>
<p>(f) <strong>Integration or "Entire Agreement" Clauses in Application-Specific Terms and Conditions.</strong> For the 
avoidance of doubt, the existence of any provision of any separate terms and conditions or agreements applicable to any 
Facebook Applications to the effect that such terms or agreement constitute the entire agreement or understanding between 
you and Facebook with respect to any subject matter, however phrased, will not be deemed to supersede or preclude 
enforcement of any of the terms and conditions set forth in paragraphs III (c), (d) (e) and (g) and this paragraph (f), , 
except to the extent that such terms directly conflict with the terms of such other agreement or terms.</p>
<p>(g) <strong>RELEASE AND DISCLAIMER.</strong> YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY RELEASE AND AGREE TO HOLD HARMLESS FACEBOOK AND 
ITS AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES AND REPRESENTATIVES, FROM ANY AND ALL 
CLAIMS, COSTS, LOSSES, LIABILITIES AND DAMAGES OF ANY SORT (WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR 
OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED)), CONTRACT, WARRANTY, 
STRICT LIABILITY, RELIANCE OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT FACEBOOK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF: (A) YOUR DOWNLOAD, INSTALLATION OR USE OF ANY FACEBOOK APPLICATIONS OR DEVELOPER 
APPLICATIONS, (B) DELIVERY OF ANY INFORMATION BY FACEBOOK TO ANY DEVELOPER; OR (C) ANY USE BY ANY DEVELOPER OF ANY 
INFORMATION, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH USE IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEVELOPER AGREEMENT. SUCH LIMITATION SHALL APPLY 
NOTWITHSTANDING A FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
<p>SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
 <p>(h) <strong>Modifications.</strong> Facebook reserves the right to modify these Platform Application Terms of Use at 
any time, in its sole discretion. If Facebook elects to modify this Agreement, Facebook will post a change notice or a 
new agreement on the Facebook Site. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOUR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO REVOKE YOUR 
PERMISSION FOR FACEBOOK TO PROVIDE FACEBOOK SITE INFORMATION TO DEVELOPERS AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (h) ABOVE. IF YOU DO 
NOT REVOKE SUCH PERMISSION PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ANY CHANGE NOTICE OR NEW AGREEMENT POSTED ON OUR SITE, YOU WILL 
BE CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHANGE. </p>
